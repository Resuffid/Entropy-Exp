It is still an open question whether cognitive improvements might depend on specific musical piece features (Mozart effect) or on the pleasure that we feel while listening. The general aim was to evaluate the attentional blink effect in music experts and non-experts (Musicians and Non-Musicians). The Mozart Sonata K448 was compared to highly pleasant musical pieces, self-selected by the participants. While listening to music, a rapid serial visual presentation task (RSVP) was used to tap into temporal attentional mechanisms. The results showed (at lag 240ms) a better performance during both the Sonata K448 and the self-selected pieces. Furthermore, the effect of pleasure varied with musical expertise. The higher the perceived pleasantness was for Musicians the higher the performance was accurate. These findings highlight the role of musical pleasure on cognitive processing. Our results emphasize the pleasure feelings evoked by music, even in experts, in affecting attention by boosting positive emotions and reward.},

Students completed standardized measures to assess test anxiety and state mindfulness pre- post-colouring intervention, immediately prior to completing a test, in addition to a measure of dispositional mindfulness. Results showed a significant decrease in test anxiety and a significant increase in state mindfulness following both activities; however, a gender by group by time interaction was found such that females reported a greater decrease in test anxiety in the free condition compared to males. Furthermore, the baseline measures (pre-intervention state mindfulness and test anxiety) were found to fully mediate relations between dispositional mindfulness and the outcome measures (post-intervention state mindfulness and test anxiety).

In this study, 50 healthy volunteer participants were randomized to two equivalent brief mindfulness-based interventions, one using visual stimuli and the other auditory. For the first group, we used a 30-min computer presentation showing different images organized into colors, mandalas and landscapes (15 images × 2 min). For the second group, we created an audio track divided into the same categories as the visual group and with the same timing (15 sounds × 2 min). The results show that regardless of the condition (visual or auditory), the scores in auditory and visual memory and attention improved after meditation. Also regardless of condition, positive emotions decreased after mindfulness meditation. However, following the intervention, negative emotions decreased more sharply in the auditory group than in the visual group. These results suggest that mindfulness concentration and attention techniques presented in an auditory verbal format are more immediately effective at the emotional level than when presented in visual format.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that mindfulness meditation (MM) improves psychological well-being via the focusing and broadening of attention. Whilst studies show that short-term MM interventions can improve focused attention, there is little evidence to support the broadening of attention. The current study investigated the influence of a short-term MM intervention on emotion and the scope of visual attention. Seventy participants completed a global-local processing task separated into three blocks of trials, with a 10-min break between each one. During the breaks, a MM group engaged in a breath-counting task and a control group engaged in a task of their choosing. Response times to global and local targets and a measure of self-reported emotional affect were recorded for each block. Mindfulness had no impact on attention; however, both positive and negative affect decreased for the MM group across the course of the experiment. The results suggest that MM can reduce the focus on negative (and positive) thoughts, indicating possible changes to focused attention, yet a short-term intervention is not sufficient to broaden attention.},

	abstract = {Objectives Despite being an ancient tradition, meditation has only become a popular inquiry of research over the past few decades. This resurgence can partially be attributed to the popularization of Eastern meditative practices, such as mindfulness, into Western culture. Though the mechanisms of meditation are not yet scientifically well-understood, systems of attention and executive control may play an important role. The present study aimed to examine potential attentional mechanisms of attentionbased meditations across studies.
Methods This paper examines behavioral measures of attention across literature. Studies (K = 87) that assigned participants to or recruited participants who use techniques common in mindfulness practices (focused attention, open monitoring, or both) were meta-analyzed. Outcomes were coded according to attentional network (alerting, orienting, executive control) or facet of executive control (inhibition, shifting, updating).
Results Meta-analytic results suggest that generalized attention (g = 0.171, 95\% CI [0.119, 0.224]), its alerting (g = 0.158, 95\% CI [0.059, 0.256]) and executive control (g = 0.203, 95\% CI [0.143, 0.264]) networks, and the inhibition (g = 0.159, 95\% CI [0.064, 0.253]) and updating (g = 0.256 [0.176, 0.337]) facets of executive control are improved by meditation. There was significant heterogeneity in attention, the alerting and executive control networks, and the inhibition facet. Studies that taught both FA and OM techniques did not show attentional improvements over those that taught the techniques in isolation. Meditation led to greater improvements in accuracy-based tasks than reaction time tasks.
Conclusions This meta-analysis suggests that attention is likely implicated in meditation, and meditation may improve some, but not all, attentional processes. Implications for understanding meditational mechanisms and moderator-related differences are discussed.},

Immediately after completing the task, participants in the room with plants present reported feeling more attentive (an increase of 0.5 on a self-reported scale from one to five) than people in the room with no plants.},

The aim of this study was to construct an authentic insider representation of the women’s lived experiences of ‘doing colouring’. This study adopted a qualitative interview strategy and reported on the narratives of 15 women’s experiences of mindfulness colouring books. Doing colouring can achieve a distinctive form of mindfulness with therapeutic qualities. This process increased the capacity for concentration, awareness and regulation for the enhancement of spirituality and self-care practice. Spiritual meanings were attached to doing colouring, speciﬁcally spirituality as connectedness to oneself with perceived inner peace and calmness derived from the mindful meditative experience. Doing mindful colouring was identiﬁed as ‘taking time’ to practice self-reﬂection, self-awareness and self-care to promote physical, emotional and social wellbeing. The meanings and practices of mindfulness were examined to provide an explanatory framework for understanding doing colouring to achieve health beneﬁts. This research contributes to the emerging literature on mindfulness colouring books, thus advancing our understanding of the diverse beneﬁts contributing to the practitioners’ sense of wellbeing.},

The most notable addition has been that Builder interface, allowing users to create studies with minimal or no programming, while also allowing the insertion of Python code for maximal flexibility. We also present some of the other new features, including further stimulus options, asynchronous time-stamped hardware polling, and better support for open science and reproducibility. Tens of thousands of users now launch PsychoPy every month, and more than 90 people have contributed to the code. We discuss the current state of the project, as well as plans for the future.},
