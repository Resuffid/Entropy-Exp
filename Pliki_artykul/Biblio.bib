I explain how in the last 25 years research on attention has characterized the effects of covert attention on spatial ﬁlters and how attention inﬂuences the selection of stimuli of interest. This review includes the effects of spatial attention on discriminability and appearance in tasks mediated by contrast sensitivity and spatial resolution; the effects of feature-based attention on basic visual processes, and a comparison of the effects of spatial and feature-based attention. The emphasis of this review is on psychophysical studies, but relevant electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies and models regarding how and where neuronal responses are modulated are also discussed.},

Here we describe the features that have been added over the last 10 years of its development. The most notable addition has been that Builder interface, allowing users to create studies with minimal or no programming, while also allowing the insertion of Python code for maximal flexibility. We also present some of the other new features, including further stimulus options, asynchronous time-stamped hardware polling, and better support for open science and reproducibility. Tens of thousands of users now launch PsychoPy every month, and more than 90 people have contributed to the code. We discuss the current state of the project, as well as plans for the future.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that mindfulness meditation (MM) improves psychological well-being via the focusing and broadening of attention. Whilst studies show that short-term MM interventions can improve focused attention, there is little evidence to support the broadening of attention. The current study investigated the influence of a short-term MM intervention on emotion and the scope of visual attention. Seventy participants completed a global-local processing task separated into three blocks of trials, with a 10-min break between each one. During the breaks, a MM group engaged in a breath-counting task and a control group engaged in a task of their choosing. Response times to global and local targets and a measure of self-reported emotional affect were recorded for each block. Mindfulness had no impact on attention; however, both positive and negative affect decreased for the MM group across the course of the experiment. The results suggest that MM can reduce the focus on negative (and positive) thoughts, indicating possible changes to focused attention, yet a short-term intervention is not sufficient to broaden attention.},

It is still an open question whether cognitive improvements might depend on specific musical piece features (Mozart effect) or on the pleasure that we feel while listening. The general aim was to evaluate the attentional blink effect in music experts and non-experts (Musicians and Non-Musicians). The Mozart Sonata K448 was compared to highly pleasant musical pieces, self-selected by the participants. While listening to music, a rapid serial visual presentation task (RSVP) was used to tap into temporal attentional mechanisms. The results showed (at lag 240ms) a better performance during both the Sonata K448 and the self-selected pieces. Furthermore, the effect of pleasure varied with musical expertise. The higher the perceived pleasantness was for Musicians the higher the performance was accurate. These findings highlight the role of musical pleasure on cognitive processing. Our results emphasize the pleasure feelings evoked by music, even in experts, in affecting attention by boosting positive emotions and reward.},

	abstract = {Objectives Despite being an ancient tradition, meditation has only become a popular inquiry of research over the past few decades. This resurgence can partially be attributed to the popularization of Eastern meditative practices, such as mindfulness, into Western culture. Though the mechanisms of meditation are not yet scientifically well-understood, systems of attention and executive control may play an important role. The present study aimed to examine potential attentional mechanisms of attentionbased meditations across studies.
Methods This paper examines behavioral measures of attention across literature. Studies (K = 87) that assigned participants to or recruited participants who use techniques common in mindfulness practices (focused attention, open monitoring, or both) were meta-analyzed. Outcomes were coded according to attentional network (alerting, orienting, executive control) or facet of executive control (inhibition, shifting, updating).
Results Meta-analytic results suggest that generalized attention (g = 0.171, 95\% CI [0.119, 0.224]), its alerting (g = 0.158, 95\% CI [0.059, 0.256]) and executive control (g = 0.203, 95\% CI [0.143, 0.264]) networks, and the inhibition (g = 0.159, 95\% CI [0.064, 0.253]) and updating (g = 0.256 [0.176, 0.337]) facets of executive control are improved by meditation. There was significant heterogeneity in attention, the alerting and executive control networks, and the inhibition facet. Studies that taught both FA and OM techniques did not show attentional improvements over those that taught the techniques in isolation. Meditation led to greater improvements in accuracy-based tasks than reaction time tasks.
Conclusions This meta-analysis suggests that attention is likely implicated in meditation, and meditation may improve some, but not all, attentional processes. Implications for understanding meditational mechanisms and moderator-related differences are discussed.},

            This study documents some of the benefits of adding plants to a windowless work place—a college computer lab.

When plants were added to this interior space, the participants were more productive (12\% quicker reaction time on the computer task) and less stressed (systolic blood pressure readings lowered by one to four units). Immediately after completing the task, participants in the room with plants present reported feeling more attentive (an increase of 0.5 on a self-reported scale from one to five) than people in the room with no plants.},

For the first group, we used a 30-min computer presentation showing different images organized into colors, mandalas and landscapes (15 images × 2 min). For the second group, we created an audio track divided into the same categories as the visual group and with the same timing (15 sounds × 2 min). The results show that regardless of the condition (visual or auditory), the scores in auditory and visual memory and attention improved after meditation. Also regardless of condition, positive emotions decreased after mindfulness meditation. However, following the intervention, negative emotions decreased more sharply in the auditory group than in the visual group. These results suggest that mindfulness concentration and attention techniques presented in an auditory verbal format are more immediately effective at the emotional level than when presented in visual format.},

The aim of this study was to construct an authentic insider representation of the women’s lived experiences of ‘doing colouring’. This study adopted a qualitative interview strategy and reported on the narratives of 15 women’s experiences of mindfulness colouring books. Doing colouring can achieve a distinctive form of mindfulness with therapeutic qualities. This process increased the capacity for concentration, awareness and regulation for the enhancement of spirituality and self-care practice. Spiritual meanings were attached to doing colouring, speciﬁcally spirituality as connectedness to oneself with perceived inner peace and calmness derived from the mindful meditative experience. Doing mindful colouring was identiﬁed as ‘taking time’ to practice self-reﬂection, self-awareness and self-care to promote physical, emotional and social wellbeing. The meanings and practices of mindfulness were examined to provide an explanatory framework for understanding doing colouring to achieve health beneﬁts. This research contributes to the emerging literature on mindfulness colouring books, thus advancing our understanding of the diverse beneﬁts contributing to the practitioners’ sense of wellbeing.},

	abstract = {Focus is a very important element in the world of education to increase the effectiveness of other learning skills such as reading, writing and calculating. The lack of focus issue existed as the pupils were uninterested and unmotivated to learn. This has caused disruptive behaviours in the classroom which affected both teachers and pupils. An intervention was essential in curbing this problem. Hence, this study was embarked to identify the effectiveness of the Mandala Colouring Therapy in increasing Year 3 pupils’ focus during the initial lesson of the day. A mixed method study was conducted at 5 national schools in Temerloh, Pahang. The participants were 100 Year 3 low average pupils and 20 teachers who taught initial lesson periods. The data were collected through interviews and questionnaires. The quantitative data were analysed using frequency counts on SPSS, while the qualitative data were analysed using Burnard’s method. The overall findings revealed that pupils’ interest and focus has been increased with Mandala Colouring Therapy. Besides, teachers have also admitted that this method has enabled the low average pupils to answer questions correctly, complete the tasks and change their behaviours. The implication of the study is that the education stakeholders need to be made aware of these impacts in order to implement this effective method in classrooms to have a fruitful teaching and learning session.},

We examined whether brief meditation training affects cognition and mood when compared to an active control group. After four sessions of either meditation training or listening to a recorded book, participants with no prior meditation experience were assessed with measures of mood, verbal ﬂuency, visual coding, and working memory. Both interventions were effective at improving mood but only brief meditation training reduced fatigue, anxiety, and increased mindfulness. Moreover, brief mindfulness training signiﬁcantly improved visuo-spatial processing, working memory, and executive functioning. Our ﬁndings suggest that 4 days of meditation training can enhance the ability to sustain attention; beneﬁts that have previously been reported with long-term meditators.},

	abstract = {Cultivation of mindfulness, the nonjudgmental awareness of experiences in the present moment, produces beneficial effects on well-being and ameliorates psychiatric and stress-related symptoms. Mindfulness meditation has therefore increasingly been incorporated into psychotherapeutic interventions. Although the number of publications in the field has sharply increased over the last two decades, there is a paucity of theoretical reviews that integrate the existing literature into a comprehensive theoretical framework. In this article, we explore several components through which mindfulness meditation exerts its effects: (a) attention regulation, (b) body awareness, (c) emotion regulation (including reappraisal and exposure, extinction, and reconsolidation), and (d) change in perspective on the self. Recent empirical research, including practitioners’ self-reports and experimental data, provides evidence supporting these mechanisms. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies have begun to explore the neuroscientific processes underlying these components. Evidence suggests that mindfulness practice is associated with neuroplastic changes in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, temporo-parietal junction, fronto-limbic network, and default mode network structures.The authors suggest that the mechanisms described here work synergistically, establishing a process of enhanced self-regulation. Differentiating between these components seems useful to guide future basic research and to specifically target areas of development in the treatment of psychological disorders.},

Results: The prefrontal cortex, the cingulate cortex, the insula and the hippocampus showed increased activity, connectivity and volume in stressed, anxious and healthy participants. Additionally, the amygdala showed decreased functional activity, improved functional connectivity with the prefrontal cortex, and earlier deactivation after exposure to emotional stimuli.
Conclusion: Demonstrable functional and structural changes in the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, insula and hippocampus are similar to changes described in studies on traditional meditation practice. In addition, MBSR led to changes in the amygdala consistent with improved emotion regulation. These ﬁndings indicate that MBSR-induced emotional and behavioral changes are related to functional and structural changes in the brain.},

We prospectively examined individual trajectories of state mindfulness in meditation during a mindfulness-based intervention in relation to changes in trait mindfulness and psychological distress. Each week during the eight-week intervention, participants reported their state mindfulness in meditation after a brief mindfulness meditation. Participants also completed pre- and post-intervention measures of trait mindfulness and psychological symptoms. Tests of combined latent growth and path models suggested that individuals varied signiﬁcantly in their rates of change in state mindfulness in meditation during the intervention, and that these individual trajectories predicted pre-post intervention changes in trait mindfulness and distress. These ﬁndings support that increasing state mindfulness over repeated meditation sessions may contribute to a more mindful and less distressed disposition. However, individuals’ trajectories of change may vary and warrant further investigation.},
